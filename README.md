## Description
Since many of my old photos miss the 'Date taken' attribute and have wrong timestamps for 'Last modified' and 'Date created', I created this tool so I can apply proper timestamps before I upload them to the cloud.


## What does it do?
Sets EXIF attribute 'Date taken' to a default date and updates the 'Last modified' timestamp to that date.
